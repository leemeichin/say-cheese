Say Cheese!
===========
A minimal library for integrating webcam snapshots into your app. It uses `getUserMedia`, a recent API for
accessing audio and video in the browser.

[**Demo**](http://leemachin.github.com/say-cheese)

Setup
-----
Grab the JS, host it, and add it to your page. For example:

```html
<script src='/assets/js/say-cheese.js'></script>
```

Usage
-----

Say Cheese exposes a minimal, event based API:

```javascript
var sayCheese = new SayCheese('#container-element', { snapshots: true });

sayCheese.on('start', function() {
 // do something when started
 this.takeSnapshot();
});

sayCheese.on('error', function(error) {
 // handle errors, such as when a user denies the request to use the webcam,
 // or when the getUserMedia API isn't supported
});

sayCheese.on('snapshot', function(snapshot) {
  // do something with a snapshot canvas element, when taken
});

sayCheese.start();
```

Taking snapshots
----------------

You can take a snapshot at any time after initialisation, by calling
`takeSnapshot()`:

```javascript
sayCheese.on('snapshot', function(snapshot) {
  // do something with the snapshot
});

sayCheese.takeSnapshot();
```

If you need to change the size of the snapshot created, pass in the new width and height as arguments:

```javascript
var width = 640, height = 480;
sayCheese.takeSnapshot(width, height);
```

It defaults to the full size of the video (generally `640x480`) if the arguments are omitted.

I don't want snapshots; just give me the video!
-----------------------------------------------

No problem. Just disable it when you first create the instance:

```javascript
var sayCheese = new SayCheese('#container-element', { snapshots: false });
```

Note that when you do this, `takeSnapshot()` will not do anything.

Stopping the show
-----------------

There's also a function to stop the webcam after loading it up:

```javascript
sayCheese.on('stop', function() {
  // do something when it's stopped
});

sayCheese.stop();
```

Audio support
-------------

Audio's disabled by default, because it doesn't have full browser support. You can still enable it
for browsers that do support it, though. Just set `audio` to true when setting up.

```javascript
var sayCheese = new SayCheese('#container-element', { audio: true });
```

This will request access to the microphone, and will currently pipe the audio through to your
output device.

This is supported in:

- Google Chrome
- Firefox 25+
- Latest Opera

Resources, things using Say Cheese, etc.

If you have any useful resources, or things you did with Say Cheese
that you think should be shown off, by all means open a pull request
or an issue or whatever.


Tests
-----

Some basic tests cover the callback functionality. They were written
to be run in a browser that supports the `getUserMedia` API. Due to
the nature of that API, there is no automation for allowing or denying
the request, so it has to be done manually for each one.

Compatibility
-------------

**Tested and verified to work in:**

- Firefox
- Google Chrome
- Opera
